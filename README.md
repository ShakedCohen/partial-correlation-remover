# partial-correlation-remover

Fairness in machine learning has become a critical issue in
recent years, as models can unintentionally discriminate against certain
groups of people. To address this issue, various fairness definitions
have been proposed, and numerous methods have been developed to
achieve fairer models. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to improve fairness through correlation removal using partial correlation. Our
proposed method involves using partial correlation to calculate the correlation between each feature and the sensitive feature while controlling
for other features. We evaluate our approach on four real-world datasets,
demonstrating that our method can balance the performance-fairness
trade-off and add another preprocessing tool to the data science toolbox
for building fairer models. Our results suggest that our method can be
effective in mitigating discriminatory effects while retaining high performance, and thus, it can help to promote fairness in machine learning
applications.
